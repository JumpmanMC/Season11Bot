Listen, New Amsterdam, you may not know me because I haven’t been with all of you from the beginning of the start. Now listen, there are things, there are qualities that I have, there are qualities that you don’t know I have, and it’s totally evident that we’re here today in this room, not because of me, but because of certain people in this room. Now it stands to reason that you haven’t seen my abilities, you don’t know what I’m like. Now I’m here to tell you exactly who I am. I grew up in the Middle East. I’m no local of the United States. I’m foreign. I grew up in the deserts. I rode camels through deserts. I’ve ridden elephants through Sri Lanka. I’ve surfed waves of Sri Lanka, there’s so many things you don’t know about me, and if you’re so quick to judge who I am just because I wasn’t here, that is on you.
